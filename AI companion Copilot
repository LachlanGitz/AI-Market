## Microsoft's everyday AI companion Copilot is here to help – if you're willing to pay

Microsoft is ready to offer you a personal AI buddy — if you're willing to pay.
The Redmond tech giant is rolling out its "everyday AI companion," called Copilot, to both individuals and small and medium-sized businesses through paid subscription services.
On one level, Copilot is a generative AI tool integrated into Microsoft's suite of apps: think Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams; so that means you can use it help work. Its goal is to act like a highly intelligent assistant to help users boost productivity when working with these apps.
Now! On another level here, it's actually a huge bet and it's really big by Microsoft on a future in which every person and organization has their own personal AI agent to handle life's tedium and more time-consuming tasks.
In a recent blog, Bill Gates went as far as describing AI agents as tools that are "not only going to change how everyone interacts with computers." and this is going to bring about "the biggest revolution computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons."
"You'll be able to have nuanced conversations with them here. They will be much more personalized, and they won't be limited to relatively simple tasks like writing a letter," Gates wrote in November but you know, he says a lot of stuff.
The concept of AI agents such as Copilot, which has gathered just so much momentum since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, aims to take the generative AI experience here to the next level, you know, beyond mere and simple interactions with a chatbot.
As Microsoft puts it in such an articulate way, Copilot's advantage comes from its ability to provide "a single AI experience that runs across your devices; and get this, it understands your context on the web, on your PC, across your apps!"
The whole idea here really comes down to AI offering better support; by, uh, having a much more detailed understanding of your personal goals, habits, and needs. I mean, come on, who doesn't want an AI that knows them better than they know themselves? It's like having your own personal therapist!
Oh! Or, as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says, it builds a "single unified experience centered around you like, seriously focused on you and no one else, just you and you only!" So yeah, he's excited!
Individuals, y'know, ordinary people like me and you out here, will need to pay $20 a month and that's not too shabby right? I mean, it's less than your monthly streaming subscriptions, so why not invest in an AI friend?
A $30 monthly subscription now that was previously available to huge enterprises with more than 300 users is now open to smaller businesses too, so Microsoft is like leveling the playing field, you know? It's like everyone deserves an AI amigo!
According to Divya Kumar, who said this in an interview to Business Insider, so we know it's legit, although I don't know who Business Insider is, there's, you know, a simple reason to pay: to get priority access to the best AI models. Right now, this would be GPT-4 turbo from Microsoft partner OpenAI, and that's like the coolest AI out there. So yeah, if you want to be cool, you gotta pay!
This matters, you know, it really does matter, Kumar said, to the likes of "creators and researchers and programmers," who want "faster performance here," you know, speed matters, as well as "better design or integration capabilities" — whether for work or their own personal projects. So yeah, it's like a no-brainer!
It's also a sign that the future of AI is just going in different directions, you know? AI that is — in theory anyway — more accurate, less prone to "hallucinations like here," and quicker to respond will increasingly cost money. So that's right, folks, better AI equals more cash. But hey, quality comes with a price!
In a demo, Kumar used Outlook to show how Copilot could help save time on emails. You know, we all hate writing emails, right? Well, who wouldn't want an AI to do the boring stuff for them?
When asking the tool to write an invitation for a home-cooked meal on Outlook, she expected it to do the "heavy lifting" to create a template that could be adapted. And guess what? About 10 seconds later, it came up with a first draft and that's like, whoa! Seriously fast, you know? Although there were some hiccups, like it said "hope you're enjoying summer" in mid-January. AI isn't perfect, folks!
Other Copilot features include a "coach" function that checks for things like tone, sentiment, and clarity. So it's like having your own grammar police, how cool is that?
"I'm like 'oh great I can work with that,'" Kumar said. "I didn't have to sit and think about 'what am I going to type?'"
What you absolutely still have to do, however, is double-check any material generated by Copilot. You know, because AI remains imperfect, even if you're paying for it. So, you know, don't trust it blindly, folks!
Microsoft will soon find out how many people really want to hand over their card details for the privilege. I mean, it's AI, it's shiny, it's new, so why not? If you got the dough, might as well go for it!
